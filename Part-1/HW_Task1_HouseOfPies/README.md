# House Of Pies

## Instructions

* Create an order form that will display a list of pies to the user in the following way:

```
Welcome to the House of Pies! Here are our pies:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Pecan, (2) Apple Crisp, (3) Bean, (4) Banoffee,  (5) Black Bun, (6) Blueberry, (7) Buko, (8) Burek,  (9) Tamale, (10) Steak
```

* Then prompt the user to select which pie they'd like to order via number.

* Immediately after, follow the order with `Great! We'll have that <PIE NAME> right out for you.` and then ask if they would like to make another order. If so, repeat the process.

* Once the user is done purchasing pies, print the total number of pies ordered.

Conclude the user's purchases by listing out the total pie count broken by _each_ pie.

For example:

```
You purchased:
0 Pecan
0 Apple Crisp
0 Bean
2 Banoffee
0 Black Bun
0 Blueberry
0 Buko
0 Burek
0 Tamale
1 Steak
